    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Levant region of the Arab world during the Ottoman Empire, consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slowly turning vertical rotisserie or spit. Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken, beef or veal. Thin slices are shaved off the cooked surface as it continuously rotates. Shawarma is a popular street food throughout the Arab world and the Greater Middle East.
