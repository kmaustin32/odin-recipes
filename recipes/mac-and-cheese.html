    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Macaroni and cheese (also called mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar sauce.

        Its origins trace back to cheese and pasta casseroles dating to the 14th century in Italy and medieval England. The traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a BÃ©chamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.
