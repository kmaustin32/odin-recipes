    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Macaroni and cheese (also called mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar sauce. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Its origins trace back to cheese and pasta casseroles dating to the 14th century in Italy and medieval England. The traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a BÃ©chamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.
